            <h1>ANDERSEN AFB RECEPTION CHECKLIST</h1>
            <h2>AS OF: April 2023</h2>
            <!-- This creates a horizontal line -->
            <p><strong>NON-US/FOREIGN UNITS</strong> request to operate on AAFB for training when invited as a
                participant in
                official US exercises. If there are no US aviation assets with thatspecific exercise on AAFB, a
                <strong>US LIASISON IS REQUIRED</strong>
                and must accompany the non-US/foreign military while they conduct all operations on
                AAFB including ADVON and POST deployment. The US Exercise originator is responsible to provide this
                liaison and fund any relevant TDY costs. This named US Liaison should be used as your POC when filling
                out EALs, FVRs, and flight line entry request paperwork with a current phone number and email.
                *A LIAISON is not required for RON or ferry flight operations.
            </p>
            <p>To ensure proper coordination installation support for your mission, the following checklist must be
                thoroughly reviewed, completed, and provided to 36 LRS Readiness Flight (36 LRS/LGRDX) 120 day
                out from execution. IDRC will coordinate all checklist requests for you and provide your unit with the
                results of the coordination process no later than (NLT) 2 weeks from the earliest indicated arrival
                date.
                All attachments referenced in this checklist are at the end of the document.
            </p>

            <p>It is the responsibility of the both the incoming units to follow up with the AAFB Reception Working
                Group (RWG) reps to obtain a status update on their requests. The RWG reps will work the support
                request at the direction of IDRC and may need to ask the incoming units specific questions about their
                requests, in which case they will ask the incoming unitsâ€™ POCs. However, it is still the responsibility
                of
                the incoming unit to clarify all requests to the RWG reps, whether the request is unique or not.
            </p>
            <p>To guarantee receipt of your request, the completed reception checklist must be sent electronically to
                our
                distribution list (36wg.idrc@us.af.mil (unclassified) or 36wg.idrc@andersen.af.smil.mil (classified))
                with
                a follow-up phone call to 366-1844/2331/3464/1769. Due to some unique capabilities at AAFB, keep in
                mind, that if an item of support is not sufficiently indicated on the checklist, you may not receive the
                level
                of support you expect.
            </p>
            <p>As an additional note, the AAFB Reception Working Group (RWG) convenes weekly to discuss
                reception support requirements of all inbound units. We encourage visiting units to attend RWG
                meetings during their site visit or upon advanced party (ADVON) arrival. Please contact our office prior
                to arrival so we can accommodate your attendance.
            </p>
            <p>All units arriving on AAFB in support of contingency or AEF deployments are requested to send 36
                LRS/IDRC a passenger manifest as soon as one is available. This will benefit us in getting you a
                speedy response regarding what AAFB can give your unit while on station.
            </p>
            <p>The following timeline will facilitate your mission success. Many of these items are time sensitive
                and failure to complete them as indicated may directly affect your support.
            </p>

                <h1>STATEMENT OF AGREEMENT / UNDERSTANDING:</h1>
                <p><strong>Funding:</strong> I understand that most support functions at Andersen AFB are limited due to
                    minimal funding
                    and that my unit must provide funding documents (DD form 448, MIPR) and/or account information
                    prior to arrival. <strong>Priority support:</strong> I understand contingency operations may take
                    precedence over
                    exercise operations, and some services previously agreed upon may be adjusted to meet these
                    requirements. <strong>Safety</strong> I will ensure all personnel employing from Andersen AFB
                    receive a
                    Guam local
                    conditions safety briefing, either before departing home station or within 24 hours of arrival.
                    <strong>Stewardship / Accountability: </strong> I will ensure all issued facilities, keys,
                    equipment,
                    and vehicles will be
                    returned prior to my unit departing the installation. If loss or damage is noted upon return, I will
                    ensure a
                    funding document is provided for replacement or repair. Requests for changes to turn-in procedures
                    will
                    be coordinated in advance and will be accommodated on an as available basis. I understand my unit is
                    responsible for the cost of damaged facilities, equipment, and vehicles.
